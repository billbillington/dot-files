# This code is a hack to to allow you to use the share ssh authentication socket
# between tmux sessions started in different terminals
#
# In the words of https://github.com/lmars:
#
#   SH_AUTH_SOCK is a path to a socket connected to the machine you ssh'd from, so
#   when authenticating it pipes requests back down this socket.
#
#   This socket is created at a random path everytime you SSH in, so this change just
#Â   symlinks the a predictable path to the random path (in my case /tmp/ssh-agent-ubuntu-tmux).

SSH_SOCK="/tmp/ssh-agent-$USER-tmux"
if test $SSH_AUTH_SOCK && [ $SSH_AUTH_SOCK != $SSH_SOCK ]
then
  rm -f $SSH_SOCK
  ln -sf $SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SSH_SOCK
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_SOCK
